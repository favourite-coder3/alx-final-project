This is a project done as my Alx-portfolio-project. My personal final fullstack project as an alx student. This project identified a problem with Nigerians And africans willing to learn tech  and that is - the lack of local instructors using the local language to teach difficult concepts. As a result, I came up with this idea to build a learning academy where all Nigerians and Africans at large would have access to free and premuim resources to aid their learning and gain in-demand skills.
The webapp is not yet completed, but a tremendous project has been made.
